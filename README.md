# webexteamsbot
This package makes creating [Webex Teams](https://www.webex.com/products/teams/index.html) bots in Python super simple.  

> This package is based on the previous [ciscosparkbot](https://github.com/imapex/ciscosparkbot) project.  This version will both move to new Webex Teams branding as well as add new functionality.  If you've used `ciscosparkbot` you will find this package very similar and familiar.
